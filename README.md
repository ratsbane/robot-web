### Control a LeRobot arm via web ###


Control a LeRobot SO-ARM100 via a webpage.  Watch a video stream of the arm in action and control its movements with keyboard commands, or plug in a gamepad for better control.  You can also start and stop episode recordings, which are stored in the LeRobot/Gr00t format.

This runs well on a Raspberry Pi 5.
